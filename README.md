# Data-Science-Final-Project
This project, created by Shreya Aggarwal, Jai Sagar, and Anjali Vajjalla for the CS 439 Data Science course, focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle factors. Using a cleaned and preprocessed dataset from KaggleHub (~10,000 entries), we trained and evaluated multiple ML models.
